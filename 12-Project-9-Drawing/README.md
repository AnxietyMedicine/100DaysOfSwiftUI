# Project 9 - Drawing

This project includes solutions to the challenges.

## Challenges

1. Create an `Arrow` shape â€“ having it point straight up is fine. This could be a rectangle/triangle-style arrow, or perhaps three lines, or maybe something else depending on what kind of arrow you want to draw.
2. Make the line thickness of your `Arrow` shape animatable.
3. Create a `ColorCyclingRectangle` shape that is the rectangular cousin of `ColorCyclingCircle`, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using one or more properties.
