# Project 3 - Views and Modifiers

This project includes solutions to the challenges.

## Challenges

1. Go back to [project 1](https://github.com/AnxietyMedicine/100DaysOfSwiftUI/tree/main/01-Project-1-WeSplit) and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.
2. Go back to [project 2](https://github.com/AnxietyMedicine/100DaysOfSwiftUI/tree/main/03-Project-2-GuessTheFlag) and replace the `Image` view used for flags with a new `FlagImage()` view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
3. Create a custom `ViewModifier` (and accompanying `View` extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.
